        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked coarse-ground polenta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Baking/Serving:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups hot prepared meat sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare polenta: Bring water and salt to a boil over high heat.
            Whisk polenta into the boiling water and continue whisking until it starts to thicken, about 1 minute. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, until polenta is soft and has lost its grainy texture, 25 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove polenta from the stove and quickly whisk in butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Transfer polenta to a silicone baking liner (or oiled foil or parchment paper). 
            Spread it out evenly almost to the edges into an 8x13-inch rectangle. 
            Cover with plastic wrap and smooth out the top with your hands. 
            Place a baking sheet on top and press slightly to further flatten.</li>
        <li>Slide the silicone liner and polenta onto the baking sheet and place in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove polenta from the refrigerator and cut, from one long edge to the other, into 8-inch long strips.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling: Stir ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, mozzarella, salt, pepper, cayenne, egg, and parsley in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>Place one strip of polenta into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan. Spread 1/3 of the filling on top as evenly as you can. 
            Top with about 1 cup hot meat sauce. Repeat polenta-filling-sauce layers twice more. Place the last piece of polenta on top, 
            then gently shake and tap the pan to settle the contents. Place the loaf pan on top of a sheet pan to catch any spills while baking. 
            Loosely wrap the top of the loaf pan with foil, making sure it's not touching the polenta.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, discard foil, and let rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>  
        <li>Divide onto 6 plates. Garnish with parsley and serve with additional sauce.</li>
    </ol>
