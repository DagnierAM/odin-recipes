    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An easy recipe made with both fresh strawberries and canned strawberry pie filling. 
        The cream cheese gives it a bit of a tang and the crumble reminds me of a sugar cookie.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh strawberries, diced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can strawberry pie filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch dish with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle strawberries with sugar and let rest until strawberries release their juices, about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Combine cake mix and melted butter in a separate bowl and mix until mixture comes together as a crumble.</li>
